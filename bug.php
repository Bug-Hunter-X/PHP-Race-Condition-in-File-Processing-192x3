This code suffers from a potential race condition.  If `processFile()` takes a significant amount of time, and another request comes in before it's finished, the second request might overwrite the file before the first one completes, leading to data loss or corruption.  The `flock()` call isn't sufficient to prevent this if multiple requests are occurring concurrently.

```php
<?php
function processFile($filename, $data) {
  if (file_exists($filename)) {
    return false; //already exist
  }
  $file = fopen($filename, "w+");
  if (!$file) {
    return false;
  }
  flock($file, LOCK_EX);
  fwrite($file, $data);
  fflush($file);
  flock($file, LOCK_UN);
  fclose($file);
  return true;
}

// Example usage (multiple requests might cause issues)
processFile("my_file.txt", "Data from request 1");
processFile("my_file.txt", "Data from request 2");
?>
```
